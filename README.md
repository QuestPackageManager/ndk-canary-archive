# ndk-canary-archive
Stores NDK canary builds for consistent retrieval.

We do not build, own or modify these NDK builds. They are directly retrieved from https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-master-ndk/grid.

We hope the Google/Android NDK team doesn't mind as we need R27 for [cordl generated headers to compile](https://github.com/sc2ad/cordl). See [here for the related issue.](https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/1941)
